# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data.
As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set.
Common examples include clustering, where the algorithm automatically groups its training examples into categories with similar features, 
and principal component analysis, where the algorithm finds ways to compress the training data set by identifying which features are most useful for 
discriminating between different training examples, and discarding the rest.
This contrasts with supervised learning in which the training data include pre-assigned category labels
(often by a human, or from the output of non-learning classification algorithm).

Patterns and structure can be found in unlabeled data using unsupervised learning, an important branch of machine learning. 
Clustering is the most popular unsupervised learning algorithm; 
it groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. 
Because most datasets in the world are unlabeled, unsupervised learning algorithms are very applicable.
