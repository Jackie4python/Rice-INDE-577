# K Nearest Neighbors
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.

## Dataset
**Car Evaluation**
The data used for this algorithms is a public data from UCI, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation

The data has 6 features and target, and contains 1728 rows and 7 columns with descriptions as follows:

buying: Buying Level or Capacity of the customer (Very High:vhigh, High:high, Low:low, Medium:med)  
maint: Maintainence Level (Very High:vhigh, High:high, Low:low, Medium:med)  
doors: Number of doors in the car (2, 3, 4 and 5 or more)  
persons: capacity in terms of persons to carry (2,4, and more)  
lug_boot: Luggage Boot Size in the car (small, med, big)  
safety: Safety Level of Car (high, med, low)  
class: Unacceptable, Acceptable, VeryGood, Good  

## Task

In this project, I will build a KNN model from scratch and also use the knn model imported form scikit-learn. Then compare the result or these two models.
