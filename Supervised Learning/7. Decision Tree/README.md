# Decision Tree

A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression. 
In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. 
As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions. 
**Classification and Regression Trees (CART)**
Nowadays, Decision Tree algorithm is known by its modern name CART which stands for Classification and Regression Trees. 
Classification and Regression Trees or CART is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for 
classification and regression modeling problems.The CART algorithm provides a foundation for other important algorithms like bagged decision trees, 
random forest and boosted decision trees.

In this project, I will solve a classification problem. So, I will refer the algorithm also as Decision Tree Classification problem.
