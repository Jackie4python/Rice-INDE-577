# Decision Tree

A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression. 
In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. 
As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions. 
**Classification and Regression Trees (CART)**
Nowadays, Decision Tree algorithm is known by its modern name CART which stands for Classification and Regression Trees. 
Classification and Regression Trees or CART is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for 
classification and regression modeling problems.The CART algorithm provides a foundation for other important algorithms like bagged decision trees, 
random forest and boosted decision trees.

In this project, I will solve a classification problem. So, I will refer the algorithm also as Decision Tree Classification problem.

## Task
In this notebook we implement the decision tree algorithm for binary species classification, indicating whether or not a particular internet user has clicked on an Advertisement.

## Dataset
The data used for this model is a public data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/farhanmd29/predicting-customer-ad-clicks.

The data contains the following features:  

- Daily Time Spent on Site: consumer time on site in minutes
- Age: cutomer age in years
- Area Income: Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
- Daily Internet Usage: Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
- Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement
- City: City of consumer
- Male: Whether or not consumer was male
- Country: Country of consumer
- Timestamp: Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
- Clicked on Ad: 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
